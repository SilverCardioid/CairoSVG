A work-in-progress fork of the vector graphics converter [CairoSVG](https://github.com/Kozea/CairoSVG/). It is intended to be a more modular version of the library, allowing its drawing functionality to be used directly from a script in addition to its original purpose of parsing and converting SVG files.

Other branches and related repositories:
* [CairoSVG/master](https://github.com/SilverCardioid/CairoSVG/tree/master/): for proposed changes to the original library
